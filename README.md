## How to use the system
Step 1: You should purchase a Raspberry Pi and install an ubuntu system in it.
Step 2: Our face recognition algorithm is from [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet). Watching how to train your model and get checkpoint from this link. There are two checkpoints here, the first one is provided in the link; and the second one is trained by yourself.
Step 3: We lost the code on Raspberry Pi, thus, you could find any camera code of Raspberry Pi and send the image to the sever when using it.
Step 4: Change the path in the code to your config including IP and model path.

##Tip
Any code except test.py shouldn't be modified.

##Acknowledgment
The model come from [FaceNet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).
